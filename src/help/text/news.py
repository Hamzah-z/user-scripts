    text="""This is RedBrick's famous news system!
There are over 65 "news boards" on all sorts of topics; sports, tv
programmes, news, debates, shopping, jobs, academic etc.

The first time you use this:
You will see a list of all the news boards available. Navigate using the
up and down arrow keys and press 's' on the topics that interest you. These
will remain in future and are the ones you will be subscribed to.

General:
Press the enter key on a topic ('board') you want to read. You will see a
new screen with a list of all the 'posts' on that board. Press the enter
key again to read a post. If you want to make a followup to that post on
the board, press 'f' when you are reading it. If you wish to make a post
yourself to a topic/board, go back to the main screen and press 'p' when
you are on the desired topic.

At any time during reading you can press 'q' to get you back to a previous
screen or to quit.""",
