"""hey help text"""

HEY = dict(
    text="""Need to send a message to someone who's logged onto Redbrick? Perhaps to a
friend or maybe to a complete stranger!? All that's required is to type
"hey username" (without the quotes and with the correct username of
course!)

You can start typing the message straight away. Once you're finished, hold
down the control (Ctrl) button and hit the D key (known as "control-D"). If
you want to abort a message hit "Control-C". To get a list of users
currently logged in, type "rbusers".

It's worth pointing out that people on Redbrick sometimes keep a copy of
heys they recieve in a file (imaginatively called a "heyfile") especially
if they're funny, entertaining or useful for future blackmailing.. you have
been warned!""",
