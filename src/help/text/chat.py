CHAT = dict(
    text="""Chat is the closest thing to talking to "real people" on Redbrick.
If you've never been in a chat room before, it's basically a "room"
where you can type in stuff and talk directly to other people who are
in the room with you. Stuff you type comes up immediately on the screen.
When you're finished and want to leave, type /quit and press return.
And basically that's the gist of it.

Sometimes the conversation is crap, scary, funny, interesting, or even
informative, but basically the idea is to have a bit of fun, and to
try and guess which ones in the chat room are axe murderers and which
are sane nice people that are friend material. Depending on the people
in the chat room at different times, this can either be easy or
difficult to find out, but it definitely gets easier with practice.

You can even get stats on Redbrick's chat room on the web at

(type 'chat' at the command line to get into chat).
