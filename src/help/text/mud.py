MUD = dict(
    text="""MUD stands for Multi-User-Dungeon, but forget about that,
basically it's an online text adventure type game where you
can interact with other people who are online playing it,
explore the surroundings, fight, kill things, collect treasure,
and other nerdy gaming-y stuff like that.

Lots of people on Redbrick are starting to play it now though,
it's become scaringly popular, so give it a go and see what it's
like for yourself, if at least to laugh at all the other heads
playing it and perhaps kill a few monsters n'stuff.

(Simply type 'mud' at the command line).""",
