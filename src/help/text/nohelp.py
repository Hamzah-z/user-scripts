log in? Are you now completely "3133t" and know all of the commands
on that menu off by heart?

Well if so, congrats (note sarcasm), but you can get rid of the menu
by typing 'nohelp' at the command line. If at any time you need some
help though and would like to see the menu again, simply type 'help'
at any time you need it.

The nohelp command stops the help menu from loading up every time
you log in.""",
