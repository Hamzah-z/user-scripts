** WARNING - Do not use this command if you are unsure
** of what you are doing! :-)

A "Shell" is the style of command line environment on RedBrick.
It is essentially, the 'prompt' and set of commands that you get
when you log in.

Changing this means that your screen prompt may look different,
& some commands may be different. Here are some possible shells:
/usr/local/shells/bash
/usr/local/shells/tcsh
/usr/local/shells/ksh
/usr/local/shells/zsh

However Redbrick only fully supports zsh or bash."""
